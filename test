Summary
Computer Science undergraduate at Universiti Malaya with interests in Machine Learning and Software Engi-
neering. I enjoy learning new systems and concepts quickly through hands-on work, self-study, and exchanging
knowledge with teammates to solve problems. Open to full-time opportunities before and after graduation in
2026.

Work Experience
Lead Backend Developer – Infinity Data Tech Sdn. Bhd. June 2024 – Present
•Scaled backend team from 20 interns to 5 full-time backend developers; established coding standards, tech
stack, documentation, onboarding, and review processes and oversaw development in malaysian branch.
•Designed Java (Spring) systems handling 4M+ users and 400K+ concurrent sessions; led DevOps and infras-
tructure strategy.
•Designed high-availability data layer with PostgreSQL (CloudNativePG) replication, Redis caching, Kafka
(Strimzi) + ClickHouse analytics, and S3 offsite backups.
•Managed on-prem Kubernetes (RKE2/Rancher) with OpenEBS storage, Cilium networking.
•Built observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki), reverse proxy/caching (NGINX, Caddy), and OAuth/IAM
via Keycloak.
•Implemented CI/CD GitOps with FleetCD, containerization, Flyway migrations, disaster recovery snapshots,
and automated backups.
•Integrated payments (PayPal, Stripe, Weixin Pay), cloud storage (Cloudflare R2, AWS S3), and automated
alerting.
Software Developer – Infinity Data Tech Sdn. Bhd. (Online) March 2023 – June 2024
•Maintained Java Spring applications, specializing in batch processing; worked extensively with IoC/DI, Web-
MVC, AOP, Spring Security, JMS, JMX, JPA, Resilience4j, Hibernate ORM, and Quartz scheduling.
•Applied backend engineering best practices including transaction management, lazy loading, database index-
ing/partitioning, RESTful API design and containerization.
•Familiar with optimizing network routes and transits such as CN2 GT, CN2 GIA.
Teaching Assistant - University of Malaya October 2023 - June 2024
•Taught Fundamentals of Programming (WIX1002) and Data Structures (WIA1002) to 90+ students over two
semesters for developing communication and teaching skills.
Projects
Custom ML Model Deployment |Django, TorchServe, MLOps 2024
•Refactored friend’s Master’s thesis Video Understanding model with full-graph computation and JIT compi-
lation, doubling inference speed. Deployed using TorchServe on SageMaker as MAR file with Django backend
and async inference over gRPC from Celery queue.
•Achieved 60% request reduction using Cloudflare CDN Edge Donut caching on webserver as an SSR appli-
cation, R2 storage for saving generations, and htmx for dynamic content.
Distributed Key-Value Store |Java 2023
•Implemented distributed KV store inspired by Amazon’s Dynamo Paper, employing Rendezvous hashing for
load distribution of keys, minimizing data transfer during cluster resizing. Learned about RAFT consensus
protocol and implementations such as JRAFT.
•Built cluster management system with peer-to-peer based coordination and type preservation during serial-
ization.
Educational Web Server |Java 2023
•Built a custom HTTP server in Java without dependencies as a template for programming students to extend.
Uses raw sockets to parse HTTP requests and handle routing. Features include a custom templating engine
with loops and variables, plus session management. Helps students understand web server fundamentals
