## What is TCP/IP?

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the fundamental communication protocol suite that powers the internet. It defines how data should be packaged, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received across networks.

## The Four Layers

TCP/IP operates on four distinct layers:

1. **Application Layer** - Where applications like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP operate
2. **Transport Layer** - TCP and UDP protocols ensure reliable data delivery
3. **Internet Layer** - IP handles routing and addressing
4. **Network Interface Layer** - Physical network hardware communication

## Why TCP/IP Matters

```bash
# Simple ping command uses ICMP over IP
ping google.com
```

TCP/IP ensures that when you send data across the internet, it arrives at the correct destination in the right order. TCP handles the reliability, while IP handles the routing.

## Key Benefits

- **Reliability**: TCP ensures data integrity and delivery
- **Scalability**: Works from small LANs to the global internet
- **Interoperability**: Platform and vendor independent

Understanding TCP/IP is essential for anyone working with networks, from web developers to system administrators.
