## What are Neural Networks?

Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks in the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information and learn patterns from data.

## Basic Structure

A neural network typically consists of:

/>

1. **Input Layer** - Receives raw data
2. **Hidden Layers** - Process and transform data
3. **Output Layer** - Produces final predictions

## Simple Example in Python

```python
import numpy as np

# Simple perceptron
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def neural_network(inputs, weights, bias):
    # Calculate weighted sum
    weighted_sum = np.dot(inputs, weights) + bias
    
    # Apply activation function
    output = sigmoid(weighted_sum)
    return output

# Example usage
inputs = np.array([0.5, 0.3, 0.2])
weights = np.array([0.4, 0.7, 0.2])
bias = 0.1

prediction = neural_network(inputs, weights, bias)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
```

## How They Learn

Neural networks learn through **backpropagation**:

1. Make predictions on training data
2. Calculate error between prediction and actual result
3. Adjust weights to minimize error
4. Repeat until convergence

## Real-World Applications

- **Image Recognition** - Identifying objects in photos
- **Natural Language Processing** - Understanding and generating text
- **Recommendation Systems** - Suggesting content based on preferences
- **Medical Diagnosis** - Analyzing medical images and data

## Why Neural Networks Matter

Neural networks have revolutionized AI by enabling machines to:
- Learn complex patterns from data
- Adapt to new information
- Solve problems that traditional programming couldn't handle

They're the foundation behind technologies like ChatGPT, image recognition, and autonomous vehicles.
