## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Think of it as the operating system for your distributed applications.

## Core Concepts

### Pods

The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, typically containing one container:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Services

Expose your pods to network traffic:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

## Why Use Kubernetes?

- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically scale applications based on demand
- **Self-healing**: Replace failed containers automatically
- **Load balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances
- **Rolling updates**: Deploy new versions with zero downtime

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create a deployment
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx

# Expose the deployment
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer

# Check status
kubectl get pods
```

Kubernetes transforms how we deploy and manage applications, making scalable, resilient systems accessible to all developers.
