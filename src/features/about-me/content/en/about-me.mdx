## Why This Website Exists

I’ve never written much frontend code, so I thought this would be a good chance to start. I wanted a space to document what I learn, share useful resources, and experiment with new ideas.

The main motivation, though, is that this site is a fun project where I get to explore Astro.js. Since Astro lets different frontend frameworks coexist, it’s perfect for me—I can try out various technologies without being tied to just one.

That said, I don’t always have as much time as I’d like to work on it. After setting up the design, search, blog system, and other core features, I haven’t added much content. I hope to change that and publish more regularly in the future.

Oh, and there was one other goal: I wanted to hit a perfect Lighthouse score. You can see the result here:
