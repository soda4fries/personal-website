- **Contact API**: Update `contactApiUrl` to your backend URL
- **Themes**: Modify code syntax highlighting themes
- **Locales**: Add or change supported languages in the `i18n` section

### Key Configuration Options

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://yourdomain.com',    // Your site URL
  // ... other settings
});

// Contact API configuration
export const contactApiUrl = 'https://your-api.domain.com';
```

## üìù Adding Content

### Blog Posts

Create new blog posts in `src/features/blog/content/en/` as `.mdx` files:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "Brief description"
pubDate: 2025-01-01
tags: ['tag1', 'tag2']
featured: true
---

Your blog content with Markdown/MDX and React components...
```

### About Me

Edit your about section in `src/features/about-me/content/en/about-me.mdx`. Like blog posts, this is an MDX file where you can add rich content, React components, images, and multiple sections. It supports the same frontmatter structure as blog posts with title, description, tags, and hero images.

### Styling

Global styles and theme variables are defined in `src/styles/global.css`. This includes color schemes, animations, scrollbar styling, and the animated background effects. The site uses Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Contact Form Backend

The contact form uses a Python FastAPI backend (`contact-me.py`) that provides both API and CLI interfaces for managing anonymous messages. Features include:

- **Anonymous messaging** with unique keys for reply checking
- **Public/private message options** - users can choose to make messages publicly visible
- **Admin interface** with password authentication for managing messages
- **SQLite database** storage in `contact_messages.db`
- **Interactive CLI** with rich formatting and arrow-key navigation
- **CORS support** configured for your domain

### Setup

Set your admin password as an environment variable:
```bash
export CONTACT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

Run the setup script to configure:
```bash
# Linux/Mac
./setup-contact.sh

# Windows  
setup-contact.bat
```

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/contact/send-message` - Send anonymous messages
- `POST /api/contact/check-reply` - Check for replies using message key
- `GET /api/contact/public-messages` - Get public messages and replies
- Admin endpoints (require Bearer token authentication)

The backend starts both the API server and an interactive CLI for message management.
